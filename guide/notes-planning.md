These are the points that came out the planning sessions:

- What are responsibilities of specs?
- What are features of impl the spec should address? What level of details
    - High level protocol spec
    - Low level architecture spec
- English spec vs TLA+ spec
- Verification log/reporting/artifacts
- How does all this inform / synchronize with development ?
- Template for high and low level specs
